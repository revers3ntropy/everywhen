<section>
    <p>
        Everywhen is a journal / life logging app. It's a place to record your thoughts, feelings,
        experiences and keep track of your life.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please send us your thoughts (and any bugs you find) using
        <a
            aria-label="Report issues and feature requests"
            href="https://forms.gle/7BiaLnQhYsArYiEVA"
            rel="noreferrer"
            target="_blank"
        >
            this form<OpenInNew size="12" />
        </a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Data</h2>
    <p>
        The core of Everywhen is making you feel safe to write anything. Everything, even your
        settings, are encrypted before being stored, using your password. As your password is not
        stored on the server, even if the entire server was leaked, no-one could read your entries.
    </p>
    <p> However this security comes with a compromise: </p>
    <p>
        <b>If you lose your password, there is no way to recover your data!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I would recommend using a password manager to generate a strong password, and storing it
        somewhere safe. You can then set a passcode as an additional layer of security which is
        easier to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please disclose any security vulnerabilities to me at
        <a href="mailto:josephcoppin@gmail.com"> josephcoppin@gmail.com</a>, rather than publicly on
        the GitHub issues.
    </p>

    <h2> Entries </h2>

    <p>
        Record your entries in the <a href="/journal">journal</a>. Each entry stores a title, a
        body, a label, a timestamp and optionally your location when writing it.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can edit entries by clicking
        <NoteEditOutline />
        , but all your previous versions are stored, so you can always see what you changed and when.
        You can mark an entry as deleted, and it will be hidden from your journal. However, once you
        submit an entry, there is no way to delete it permanently.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your recent entries will appear in your journal page, as well as entries from the same day
        in previous years.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can write in MarkDown/HTML in your entries. For example
        <code>**bold**</code> or
        <code>&lt;b>bold&lt;/b></code>. The HTML is sanitized before being shown. You can insert
        images into entries by dragging and dropping them into the entry, or clicking
        <ImageArea />
        .
    </p>

    <h2>Events</h2>

    <p>
        Events are completely separate to your entries and can be modified and deleted at any time.
        Events are a way to keep track of things that happen in your life, such as birthdays,
        holidays, TV shows you've watched and more. Events can either be 'instant' event, or
        'duration' events. Instant events are events that happen at a specific time, such as a
        birthday. Duration events are events that happen over a period of time, such as a holiday.
        You can also add labels to events.
    </p>

    <h2>Timeline</h2>

    <p>
        Both your entries and events are displayed on the timeline. Instant events appear as 'pins',
        while duration events appear as 'bars'. The color of the event represents its label.
    </p>
    <p>
        Entries appear in the timeline as grey bars hanging down from the center horizontal line.
        The height of the bar represents the number of words in the entry.
    </p>
    <p>
        The blue line is the current time, which updates in real time. Zoom in and out by scrolling,
        or dragging up and down for mobile. Drag left and right to scroll through time.
    </p>
    <p>
        The short green bar always appears in the middle of our screen and is like a cursor which
        shows the date and time at that point on the timeline.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can set the starting year of the timeline in
        <a href="/settings">settings</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Blurring</h2>

    <p>
        You can toggle the blurring of various parts of the page which may contain sensitive
        information. For example, you can have everything blur after an amount of time of
        inactivity. It allows you to view pages containing sensitive information without having to
        worry about other people seeing it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Press <code>ctrl + esc</code> (or <code>cmd + esc</code> on Mac) to toggle the blurring
        across the page. You can change the configuration of this blurring in
        <a href="/settings">settings</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Gallery</h2>

    <p>
        You can view all the images you have uploaded in the
        <a href="/assets">gallery</a>. Images are not automatically deleted when you delete an
        entry. When you delete an image, the image the not removed from the entry, which will leave
        a broken link. The entire image is encrypted when stored, and included in backups.
    </p>
    <p>
        The
        <ContentCopy />
        button will copy the markdown to link to the image to your clipboard which can then be used in
        an entry.
    </p>

    <h2>Locations</h2>

    <p>
        Create a Named Location by right clicking on the map on the Map page. This will create an
        area in which entries are considered to be at that location. Click the location to change
        the name or delete, and drag to resize and move.
